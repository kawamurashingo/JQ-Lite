=head1 NAME

JQ::Lite - A lightweight jq-like JSON query engine in Perl

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.32

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use JQ::Lite;

  my $jq = JQ::Lite->new;
  my @names = $jq->run_query($json_text, '.users[].name');

  say encode_json($_) for @names;

Command-line usage mirrors the library API:

  cat users.json | jq-lite '.users[].name'
  jq-lite -r '.users[] | .name' users.json

=head1 OVERVIEW

JQ::Lite is a lightweight, pure-Perl JSON query engine inspired by the
L<jq|https://stedolan.github.io/jq/> command-line tool. It gives you jq-style
queries without requiring any XS components or external binaries, so you can
embed powerful JSON exploration directly inside Perl scripts or run it from the
included command-line client.

=head1 GETTING STARTED

=over 4

=item 1. Decode or obtain a JSON string.

  my $json_text = do { local $/; <DATA> };

=item 2. Build a JQ::Lite instance (enable C<raw => 1> to receive raw scalars
instead of JSON-encoded structures).

  my $jq = JQ::Lite->new(raw => 1);

=item 3. Run a jq-style query and iterate over the returned Perl values.

  for my $value ($jq->run_query($json_text, '.users[] | select(.active)')) {
      say $value->{name};
  }

=back

Need a REPL-style experience? Run C<jq-lite> with no query to enter interactive
mode, then experiment with filters until you find the data you need.

=head1 FEATURES AT A GLANCE

=over 4

=item * Pure Perl implementation â€“ no non-core dependencies or XS

=item * Familiar jq-inspired traversal syntax (C<.foo>, C<.foo[]>, C<.foo?>,
array slicing)

=item * Extensive library of filters for aggregations, reshaping, and string
manipulation

=item * Pipeline-friendly design that mirrors jq's mental model

=item * Command-line wrapper with colour output, YAML support, and decoder
selection

=item * Interactive shell for exploring queries line-by-line

=back

=head1 LIBRARY INTERFACE

=head2 new

  my $jq = JQ::Lite->new;

Creates a new instance. Pass C<raw => 1> to receive plain scalars (like jq's
C<-r>) instead of JSON-encoded structures. Additional options may be added in
future versions.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run_query

  my @results = $jq->run_query($json_text, $query);

Runs a jq-like query against the given JSON string.
Returns a list of matched results. Each result is a Perl scalar
(string, number, arrayref, hashref, etc.) depending on the query.

In scalar context the first result is returned, mirroring jq's behaviour.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE CLIENT

The distribution ships with C<jq-lite>, a drop-in jq-style executable that reads
JSON from STDIN or files, honours common jq flags (C<-r>, C<-c>, C<-n>, C<-s>),
and supports coloured output. Run C<jq-lite --help> for the full option list, or
C<jq-lite --help-functions> to display every built-in helper.

=head1 SUPPORTED SYNTAX

=head2 Traversal and extraction

=over 4

=item * C<.key.subkey>

=item * C<.array[0]> (index access)

=item * C<.array[]> (flatten arrays)

=item * C<.key?> (optional key access without throwing errors)

=back

=head2 Filtering and control flow

=over 4

=item * C<select(.key > 1 and .key2 == "foo")>

Evaluates jq-style conditional expressions. Conditions are treated as filters
executed against the current input; the first branch whose condition produces a
truthy result has its filter evaluated and emitted. Optional C<elif> clauses
cascade additional tests, and the optional C<else> filter runs only when no
prior branch matched. When no C<else> clause is supplied and every condition is
falsey the expression yields no output.

Example:

  if .score >= 90 then "A"
  elif .score >= 80 then "B"
  else "C"
  end

=item * C<reduce expr as $var (init; update)> (accumulate values with lexical
bindings)

=item * C<foreach expr as $var (init; update [; extract])> (stream results while
folding values)

=back

=head2 Aggregation and grouping

=over 4

=item * C<group_by(.field)>

=item * C<group_count(.field)>

=item * C<sort_by(.key)>, C<sort_desc()>

Sort array elements in descending order using smart numeric/string comparison.

Example:

  .scores | sort_desc

Returns:

  [100, 75, 42, 12]

=item * C<unique_by(.key)>

=item * C<.key | count> (count items or fields)

=item * C<.[] | select(...) | count> (combine flattening + filter + count)

=item * C<sum_by(.field)>, C<avg_by(.field)>, C<median_by(.field)>,
C<percentile(p)>, C<min_by(.field)>, C<max_by(.field)>

Project numeric values from each element and compute aggregated statistics
(sum, average, median, percentiles, min/max, etc.).

=back

=head2 String and array helpers

=over 4

=item * C<.array | map(.field) | join(", ")>

Concatenate array elements with a custom separator string.

Example:

  .users | map(.name) | join(", ")

Results in:

  "Alice, Bob, Carol"

=item * C<split(separator)>

Split string values (and arrays of strings) using a literal separator.

Example:

  .users[0].name | split("")

Results in:

  ["A", "l", "i", "c", "e"]

=item * C<explode()>

Convert strings into arrays of Unicode code points. When applied to arrays the
conversion happens element-wise, while non-string values (including hashes) are
passed through untouched. This mirrors jq's C<explode> helper and pairs with
C<implode> for round-trip transformations.

Example:

  .title | explode

Returns:

  [67, 79, 68, 69]

=item * C<implode()>

Perform the inverse of C<explode> by turning arrays of Unicode code points back
into strings. Nested arrays are processed recursively so pipelines like
C<explode | implode> work over heterogeneous structures. Non-array inputs pass
through unchanged.

Example:

  .codes | implode

Returns:

  "CODE"

=item * C<keys_unsorted()>

Returns the keys of an object without sorting them, mirroring jq's
C<keys_unsorted> helper. Arrays yield their zero-based indices, while
non-object/array inputs return C<undef> to match the behaviour of C<keys>.

Example:

  .profile | keys_unsorted

=item * C<values()>

Returns all values of a hash as an array.
Example:

  .profile | values

=item * C<paths()>

Enumerates every path within the current value, mirroring jq's C<paths>
helper. Each path is emitted as an array of keys and/or indices leading to
objects, arrays, and their nested scalars. Scalars (including booleans and
null) yield a single empty path, while empty arrays and objects contribute only
their immediate location.

Example:

  .user | paths

Returns:

  [["name"], ["tags"], ["tags",0], ["tags",1], ["active"]]

=item * C<leaf_paths()>

Enumerates only the paths that terminate in non-container values, mirroring
jq's C<leaf_paths> helper. This is equivalent to C<paths(scalars)> in jq.

Example:

  .user | leaf_paths

Returns:

  [["name"], ["tags",0], ["tags",1], ["active"]]

=item * C<getpath(path)>

Retrieves the value referenced by the supplied path array (or filter producing
path arrays), mirroring jq's C<getpath/1>. Literal JSON arrays can be passed
directly while expressions such as C<paths()> are evaluated against the current
input to collect candidate paths. When multiple paths are returned the helper
yields an array of values in the same order.

Examples:

  .profile | getpath(["name"])          # => "Alice"
  .profile | getpath(["emails", 1])     # => "alice.work\@example.com"
  .profile | getpath(paths())

=item * C<setpath(path; value)>

Sets or creates a value at the supplied path, following jq's C<setpath/2>
semantics. The first argument may be a literal JSON array or any filter that
emits path arrays. The second argument can be a literal (including JSON
objects/arrays) or another filter evaluated against the current input. Nested
hashes/arrays are automatically created as needed, and the original input is
never mutated.

Examples:

  .settings | setpath(["flags", "beta"]; true)
  .user     | setpath(["profile", "full_name"]; .name)


=item * C<pick(key1, key2, ...)>

Builds a new object containing only the supplied keys. When applied to arrays
of objects, each element is reduced to the requested subset while non-object
values pass through unchanged.

Example:

  .users | pick("name", "email")

Returns:

  [{ "name": "Alice", "email": "alice\@example.com" },
   { "name": "Bob" }]

=item * C<merge_objects()>

Merges arrays of objects into a single hash reference using last-write-wins
semantics. Non-object values within the array are ignored. When no objects are
found, an empty hash reference is returned. Applying the helper directly to an
object returns a shallow copy of that object.

Example:

  .items | merge_objects()

Returns:

  { "name": "Widget", "value": 2, "active": true }


=item * C<to_entries()>

Converts objects (and arrays) into an array of entry hashes, each consisting of
C<key> and C<value> fields in the jq style. Array entries use zero-based index
values for the key so they can be transformed uniformly.

Example:

  .profile | to_entries
  .tags    | to_entries


=item * C<from_entries()>

Performs the inverse of C<to_entries>. Accepts arrays containing
C<{ key => ..., value => ... }> hashes or C<[key, value]> tuples and rebuilds a
hash from them. Later entries overwrite earlier ones when duplicate keys are
encountered.

Example:

  .pairs | from_entries


=item * C<with_entries(filter)>

Transforms objects by mapping over their entries with the supplied filter,
mirroring jq's C<with_entries>. Each entry is exposed as a C<{ key, value }>
hash to the filter, and any entries filtered out are dropped prior to
reconstruction.

Example:

  .profile | with_entries(select(.key != "password"))


=item * C<map_values(filter)>

Applies the supplied filter to every value within an object, mirroring jq's
C<map_values>. When the filter returns no results for a key the entry is
removed, allowing constructs such as C<map_values(select(. > 0))> to prune
falsy values. Arrays are processed element-wise, so arrays of objects can be
transformed in a single step.

Example:

  .profile | map_values(tostring)
