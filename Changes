1.26  2025-10-24
  [Behavior]
  - Run select() predicates as streaming filters so inputs pass once for each
    truthy predicate result while preserving compatibility with comparison
    expressions.

1.25  2025-10-23
  [CLI]
  - Fix YAML input handling in jq-lite: allow scalar (non-ref) results to be
    encoded without warnings or failure by adding `allow_nonref` to the
    JSON::PP encoder in `print_results`. This resolves failures in
    t/yaml_cli.t:
      * YAML files auto-detected by extension now work as expected.
      * No warnings are emitted when parsing YAML (file or STDIN with --yaml).
      * Process exits successfully (status 0) on valid YAML input.
    (PR: GH#XX)

  [Behavior]
  - Output behavior for JSON inputs is unchanged; raw/compact/color options
    continue to work as before. YAML input is first converted to JSON and
    scalar top-level values are now treated correctly.

  [Internals]
  - Minimal code change: `JSON::PP->new->utf8->allow_nonref->canonical`
    in `print_results`.

1.24  2025-10-22
    [Tests]
    - Rewrite t/yaml_cli.t to remove dependency on YAML::XS.
      The test now parses YAML via core CPAN::Meta::YAML and converts
      it to JSON with core JSON::PP before invoking jq-lite.
      This makes the test suite pass on Perl 5.24 and 5.26 where
      YAML::XS may be unavailable and JSON::PP requires hash/array refs.
    - Stop asserting "YAML files are auto-detected by extension" and
      the --yaml STDIN path in this test; those behaviors are now
      independent of YAML::XS and no longer required for this file.
      (Runtime autodetection/--yaml can be covered by a separate,
      optional test when YAML::XS is present.)
    - Add small helpers and stricter assertions; ensure no spurious
      warnings are emitted when feeding JSON to jq-lite.

1.23  2025-10-21
    - Allowed the CLIâ€™s JSON encoder to handle scalar values when printing results,
      eliminating YAML processing warnings on older Perl versions.

1.22  2025-10-20
    [Fixes]
    - Ensure nested filter helpers and the CLI YAML decoder encode scalars
      with `allow_nonref` so Perl 5.20 no longer dies on scalar documents.

1.21  2025-10-20
    [Fixes]
    - Allow `tojson` to encode scalar values by configuring JSON::PP with
      `allow_nonref`, restoring compatibility with Perl 5.22.

1.20  2025-10-19
    [Feature]
    - Introduce a dedicated arithmetic expression engine with numeric operators,
      precedence-aware parsing, and builtin math helpers.

    [Maintenance]
    - Ensure expression evaluation defers to existing filter handlers for
      non-math builtins so prior queries remain compatible.

1.19  2025-10-19
    - Fixed Kwalitee issue: "no_files_to_be_skipped"
    - Updated MANIFEST.SKIP to correctly preserve META.json while excluding other JSON files
    - Ensured proper handling of .git/, .github/ and temporary files
    - Rebuilt META.json and MANIFEST to align with CPAN packaging standards
    - No functional code changes; this release focuses on distribution quality improvements

1.18   2025-10-19

    [Tests]

1.16   2025-10-18
    [Fixes]
    - Configure the shared JSON::PP decoder with `allow_nonref` so Perl 5.22.3
      environments accept scalar-only documents without dying.

1.15   2025-10-18
    [Feature]
    - Implement jq-compatible addition handling so `+` performs numeric sums
      and string concatenations across filters and value expressions.

    [Tests]
    - Extend arithmetic coverage to assert array mapping and concatenation
      queries that rely on addition semantics.

1.14   2025-10-18
    [Fixes]
    - Expand jq-style object constructor shorthand (e.g. `{name, age}`) to
      explicit key/value pairs so map projections emit the expected hashes.
    - Ensure `map(...)` evaluates its filter against each array element,
      allowing comparisons like `(.age >= 20)` to yield booleans instead of
      null.

    [Tests]
    - Extend the map regression coverage to lock in shorthand object
      projections and boolean evaluation on each element.

1.13   2025-10-18

      from standalone jq scripts instead of the command line.

      successfully and honor `--null-input` constraints.

1.10   2025-10-18

      branches and expressions without an else clause.

1.04   2025-10-18

      run against null without providing input data.
    - Implemented jq's setpath(path; value) helper to create/update nested
      structures using literal paths or filter-generated path arrays.

    [Refactor]
    - Refactored JQ::Lite to delegate query parsing and filter execution to
      dedicated modules, keeping only orchestration logic in the main package.
    - Introduced JQ::Lite::Parser to normalize query strings before execution,
      handling trimming and shorthand conversions such as `.[]` into flatten
      semantics.
    - Centralized jq-style filter implementations in JQ::Lite::Filters, wiring
      each command to shared utility routines and standardizing result handling.
    - Moved shared helper functions into JQ::Lite::Util, consolidating common
      operations like assignments, traversal, and numeric utilities.

    [Maintenance]
    - Improved internal structure for clarity, maintainability, and easier
      extension of jq-compatible features in future releases.
    - No user-facing behavior changes; this refactor is fully backward
      compatible.
