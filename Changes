    - Fixed: --raw-output (-r) now pretty-prints objects and arrays,
             and outputs scalars as plain text, matching jq behavior.
    - Improved: Output formatting now distinguishes between scalars and structures.
    - Updated: Interactive mode preserves output consistency with command-line usage.
0.13  2025-04-05
    - Added real-time interactive mode: users can now type queries character-by-character
      and see results update immediately without pressing Enter.
    - Retains previous valid results on incomplete or invalid query input.
    - Displays full JSON on startup in interactive mode using '.' as default query.
    - Automatically enters interactive mode when reading JSON from STDIN without a query.
    - No non-core modules required: implemented raw terminal mode using 'stty'.

    [Enhancement]
    - Added fallback behavior to show help message when jq-lite is executed with no arguments.
      This prevents the script from hanging waiting on STDIN and improves user experience.
